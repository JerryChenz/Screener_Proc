# Stock Screening Tool for Value Investors

## Why Use This Tool?
This tool helps investors find high-quality companies at reasonable prices. It automates the process of identifying stocks that balance value, profitability, and risk, saving hours of manual research. Inspired by strategies like Joel Greenblatt’s “Magic Formula,” it prioritizes companies that:
- Generate strong earnings relative to their price.
- Use capital efficiently to grow profits.
- Reward shareholders with dividends.
- Maintain manageable debt levels.

## How It Works
The tool does the heavy lifting in three simple steps:
1. **Scrape Data**: Fetches up-to-date financial data (e.g., prices, earnings, debt) from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Clean Data**: Organizes the data and updates market prices automatically.
3. **Screen Stocks**: Ranks companies based on four key metrics to highlight the best opportunities.

## Key Metrics Evaluated
1. **Earnings Yield**: Profitability relative to stock price.
2. **Return on Capital**: How well a company uses investments to generate profit.
3. **Dividend Yield**: Cash returned to shareholders.
4. **Debt Risk**: A company’s debt burden relative to its equity.

## Output
The script ranks stocks by their combined score. Lower scores indicate better overall performance across all metrics.

## Why It’s Useful
- **Saves Time**: Automates data collection and analysis.
- **Objective Insights**: Avoids emotional bias by relying on quantitative metrics.
- **Actionable Results**: Focuses on companies that balance value, quality, and risk.
